# Event Management System

## Overview

The **Event Management System** is a desktop-based application developed using **Java 17**, designed to simplify and streamline the process of managing event halls, schedules, and bookings. The application features a user-friendly GUI built with Java Swing and integrates with a MySQL database via JDBC.

A key component of the system is the inclusion of **RESPI (Responsive Event Scheduling and Planning Interface)**, which offers a dynamic and visual approach to managing event schedules.

## Database Design

The MySQL database includes the following normalized tables:

- `users`
- `admins`
- `events`
- `event_halls`
- `bookings`
- `notifications`

JDBC is used for connectivity and performing CRUD operations.

## Why Java 17?

Java 17 was chosen for its Long-Term Support (LTS) and modern features:

- Switch expressions for cleaner control flow
- Text blocks for easy multi-line SQL query writing
- Enhanced exception messages
- Improved performance and compatibility with modern JVMs
